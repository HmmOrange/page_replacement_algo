# How to install
- Have Python installed (Python 3.10+ preferred, or any version that Streamlit could still run).
- Access the root folder, and create a virtual environment with `python -m venv .venv`.
- Enter the virtual environment with `.venv\Scripts\activate.bat`.
- Once you entered the virtual environment, `(venv)` should appear at the very first of each command line. Now install `streamlit` and `matplotlib` with `pip install streamlit` and `pip install matplotlib`.
- Run the webpage locally with `streamlit run web.py` (If it does not work, try `python -m streamlit run web.py`).
- Alternatively, you can try using the webpage via [this link](https://page-replacement-algo.streamlit.app/).
